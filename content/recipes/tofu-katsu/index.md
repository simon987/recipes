## Ingredients

|Ingredient|Quantity|
--- | ---
Firm tofu | ~300g block
Oat milk | 1/3 cup
Flour | 1/3 cup
Corn starch | 1 Tbsp.
Paprika | 1 tsp.
Salt | 1 tsp.
Panko breadcrumbs | ~100g
Sweet chili sauce | 8 Tbsp.
Strained tomaties | 4 Tbsp.
Soy sauce | 2-4 Tbsp.
Vegan Worcestershire sauce | 1-2 Tbsp. (optional)
Rice | 1 - 1.5 cup
Napa cabbage | to taste
Green onions | to taste
Fresh limes | to taste


## Directions

1. Cut the tofu into 3 slices. Then wrap it in paper towels (or in a clean tea towel) and squeeze out as much liquid as possible. It is best to place a heavy pan or another heavy object on top of it and set aside for about 1/2 hour until the tofu looks very dry.
1. Take 2 shallow bowls. In one bowl, whisk together all the ingredients for the flour mixture (soy milk, flour, corn starch, paprika powder, and salt). Place the Panko breadcrumbs into the other bowl.
1. Dip the tofu slices into the flour mixture first, then roll them in the Panko breadcrumbs and set them aside.
1. Heat some oil in a large pan and fry the breaded tofu slices for about 5 minutes on each side until golden brown and crispy.
1. Meanwhile, cook the rice, chop the napa cabbage and stir together all the ingredients for the sauce.
1. Cut the crispy tofu katsu into slices and serve it over rice and napa cabbage with the sauce. Sprinkle with fresh spring onions and sesame seeds as desired.
