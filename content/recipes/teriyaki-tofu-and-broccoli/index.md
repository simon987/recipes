## Ingredients

|Ingredient|Quantity|
--- | ---
extra-firm (or super-firm) tofu, drained|1 (14-oz.) pkg. 
lower-sodium soy sauce (sub tamari if making gluten free)|1/3 cup 
hoisin sauce|2 Tbsp. 
honey (sub agave or maple syrup)|2 Tbsp. 
rice vinegar|2 Tbsp. 
garlic, minced|3 cloves
ground ginger|1/2 tsp. 
water|1/2 cup 
corn starch|1 Tbsp. 
neutral cooking oil, divided|3 Tbsp. 
broccoli florets|1 medium crown of broccoli
toasted sesame seeds, sliced green onion
Cooked rice or rice noodles for serving

## Directions

1.  Wrap tofu in a clean kitchen towel and press on all sides to remove as much moisture as possible. Alternatively, you can set something heavy on top (such as a cast iron skillet), and let it press for about 15 to 20 minutes, or even longer for firmer tofu. Slice tofu into bite-sized cubes.
1. In a small bowl, combine soy sauce, hoisin, honey, rice vinegar, garlic, and ground ginger; whisk well to combine. In a separate smaller bowl, combine water and corn starch; whisk well to combine. Set both bowls aside.
1. Heat 2 Tbsp. of oil in a large skillet (preferably non-stick) over medium-high. Once hot, add tofu cubes to pan. Cook, turning to crisp all sides, until the tofu is golden, about 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer tofu to a large bowl. Add remaining 1 Tbsp. oil to pan, followed by broccoli florets. Saut√© for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until crisp-tender. Transfer broccoli to the bowl with tofu. Season tofu and broccoli with a pinch of salt. 
1. Reduce heat to medium, and carefully pour soy sauce mixture into pan. Once the sauce is simmering, whisk the corn starch mixture once more and pour it into the sauce. Continue cooking, while stirring continuously, until the sauce is thickened, about 30 seconds. Turn off heat. Add tofu and broccoli back to pan, and toss to coat in teriyaki sauce. Garnish with toasted sesame seeds and green onion, if desired. Serve over rice or rice noodles.
