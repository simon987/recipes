This recipe calls for extra-firm tofu that has been frozen, a trick my mom taught me. Once defrosted, you’ll see that the tofu has become more porous, almost sponge-like: this new texture enables it to absorb flavors more readily. It works perfectly in a stir-fry and equally well in soups and stews. Another one of mom’s tricks? To simmer the tofu in salted water briefly before stir-frying. Apparently this makes the tofu hardier and less likely to crumble when jostled in the pan. I don’t question my mother’s wisdom, but this step is totally optional.

**Stir-fries are like salads**: you can put almost whatever in it and it will be a quick, healthy, delish meal. I’ve put in my favorite veggies into this recipe, but please feel free to substitute whatever hearty vegetables you have on hand. Growing up, my father even put iceberg lettuce in the mix, which I definitely do not recommend. Almost anything aside from salad greens will do: cauliflower, bok choy, onions, thin slices of potato, celery, corn...the possibilities are endless.

**Use firm or extra-firm tofu**. Tofu packages and labels can be confusing! Some silken tofus are marketed as "firm silken tofu"—avoid these! Silken tofu will disintegrate upon handling given how soft and fragile they are due to their high moisture content. While they're perfect in smoothies and hot and sour soup, soft tofus will not be able to withstand this stir-fry technique.

## Directions


1. In a medium pot of salted boiling water, simmer tofu for 2 minutes. If using frozen tofu, simmer until completely defrosted. Remove from heat and let drain in a colander lined with paper towels. When cool enough to handle, gently squeeze and pat dry. If using frozen tofu, use firmer pressure to squeeze out water.
1. Cut tofu into bite-sized pieces, then toss together with soy sauce, sesame oil, and black pepper in a medium bowl. Once liquids are absorbed, toss tofu with cornstarch. 
1. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat 2 tablespoons oil. Add tofu and let cook until golden on all sides, turning occasionally, 7 to 8 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, and remove from skillet and set aside. 
1. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil and add in garlic and ginger and cook until fragrant, 1 minute. Stir in string beans, carrots, broccoli, red pepper, and green onions. Cook until tender, about 8 to 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
1. In a small bowl, stir together soy sauce, sesame oil, water, brown sugar, and cornstarch. Return tofu to skillet and add sauce mixture to pan. Stir and cook until slightly thickened, 2 minutes.
