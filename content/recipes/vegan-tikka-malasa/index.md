## Ingredients

|Ingredient|Quantity|

coconut oil, olive oil or ghee|1–2 Tbsp. 
shallot - chopped (or sub 1/2 a red onion)|1 extra-large 
chopped ginger|1 Tbsp. 
garlic, rough chopped|4 fat cloves
cumin|1 tsp. 
coriander|1 tsp. 
ground turmeric|1 tsp. 
paprika or chili powder|1/2 tsp. 
garam masala or curry powder|1 tsp. 
black mustard seeds– optional|1 tsp. 
fennel seeds– optional|1 tsp. 
fenugreek leaves– optional|1 tsp. 
salt|1 tsp. 
diced tomatoes|14 oz. can 
full fat coconut milk|1 can 
red bell pepper - big diced|1
cauliflower - sliced into 1-inch pieces, or small florets|1 small head 
zucchini - cut into 1-inch thick half-moons (or quarters)|1
squeeze of lemon
cilantro for garnish
tofu or chickpeas

## Directions

1.  Heat oil in a large heavy bottom pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat.
1. Add shallot, ginger and garlic, and reduce heat to medium to prevent burning, stirring frequently about 3 minutes until fragrant and golden. Add spices, seeds and salt and lightly toast, while stirring 1-2 minutes, which will enhance their flavor.
1. Add the diced tomato, cook 2 more minutes, until they soften, then add the coconut milk and stir to incorporate, bringing to a simmer. Add cauliflower, red bell pepper, and zucchini, give a stir, cover and let simmer 10-12 minutes on medium low heat. Check the cauliflower – it should be just tender, or continue simmering uncovered until desired tenderness (the smaller you cut the pieces the faster this will cook).
1. Taste, add a squeeze of lemon juice. Add more salt if necessary. If you like it spicy, add cayenne to taste.
1. Gently fold in the crispy tofu, seared paneer or chickpeas and give a stir and warm through.
1. Serve in bowls over basmati rice or with naan. Garnish with cilantro.
